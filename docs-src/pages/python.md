# Setting up Python for Local Development

Multiple courses at GRCC require a working knowledge of Python, or (in the case of CIS-116) teach the concepts of programming 
using the Python programming language. For the most part, you'll probably be using [zyBooks](https://www.zybooks.com/) as a 
learning platform, and zyBooks provides a browser-based IDE within which you will complete your coursework.

It **can** be useful at times, either for troubleshooting unexpected results from zyBooks or just to experiment outside of the 
learning platform, to have the ability to write and execute Python code on your local computer. To that end, we'll walk you through a few options 
for installing Python and tools for creating Python projects.

## Install Python and IDLE

You can install Python by visiting [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The website _should_ automatically detect 
your operating system and offer the correct version to install:

Once the download has completed, launch the installer:

The default options are safe to use, so we'd recommend choosing _Install Now_. Windows users will likely benefit from also checking the _Add python.exe to PATH_ 
option at the bottom of the dialog, but it's not strictly required.

Once the installer completes, you will be able to execute Python files locally. You'll also have access to the native Python code editor, called _IDLE_:

For a simple example program you can run, to verify that Python is installed correctly, see [Python Examples - 'Hello World'](./examples/python#hello-world).

## Install (or Extend) Visual Studio Code
