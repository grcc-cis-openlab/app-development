For the most part, you’ll probably be using zyBooks as a \nlearning platform, and zyBooks provides a browser-based IDE within which you will complete your coursework.\n\nIt can be useful at times, either for troubleshooting unexpected results from zyBooks or just to experiment outside of the \nlearning platform, to have the ability to write and execute Python code on your local computer. To that end, we’ll walk you through a few options \nfor installing Python and tools for creating Python projects.\n\nInstall Python and IDLE\n\n\n     Always install Python first. Install additional tools (like VS Code or PyCharm) afterwards.\n\n\nYou can install Python by visiting https://www.python.org/downloads/. The website should automatically detect \nyour operating system and offer the correct version to install:\n\n\n\nOnce the download has completed, launch the installer:\n\n\n\nThe default options are safe to use, so we’d recommend choosing Install Now. Windows users will likely benefit from also checking the Add python.exe to PATH \noption at the bottom of the dialog, but it’s not strictly required.\n\nOnce the installer completes, you will be able to execute Python files locally. You’ll also have access to the native Python code editor, called IDLE:\n\n\n\nFor a simple example program you can run, to verify that Python is installed correctly, see Python Examples - ‘Hello World’.\n\nInstall (or Extend) Visual Studio Code\n\nVisual Studio Code (also known as VS Code) is a multi-platform code editor and development environment. It comes with native support for multiple programming \nlanguages, and has an extensive ecosystem of free or paid extensions to add support for additional languages or frameworks. To that end, it makes a great tool for \nlearning Python.\n\nIf you do not have VS Code installed, you can visit https://code.visualstudio.com/ to download the appropriate version for your \noperating system:\n\n\n\nOnce the download has completed, launch the installer. Accept the Terms of Service, and then click Next to bring up the installation options:\n\n\n\nThe default options are safe to use, so click Next until the installer begins to install VS Code. This will take a few minutes, so please be patient. Once the \ninstaller has completed, click Finish.\n\nNext, download the Python extension by visiting https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python:\n\n\n\nOnce the download has completed, launch the installer:\n\n\n\nThis will open the extension in VS Code - click the Install button to install the extension into VS Code. You may be prompted to restart VS Code, after which the \nextension will be active.\n\nInstall Pycharm\n\nAnother great option for developing in Python is PyCharm, an integrated development environment, or IDE, from JetBrains. PyCharm is an IDE focused on Python and Python-based frameworks, and is probably the best choice for complex projects.\n\nPyCharm has both a Pro (paid) version, and a Community (free) edition. Previously, these were separate downloads, but as of 2025, you can simply download one installer:\n\n\n\nOnce the download has completed, launch the installer:\n\n\n\nThe default options are safe to use, so click Next until the installer begins to install PyCharm. This will take a few minutes, so please be patient. Once the \ninstaller has completed, click Finish.\n\nThe Wrap Up\n\nThat’s it! You now have up to three new tools with which to experiment. Have fun!"}]
